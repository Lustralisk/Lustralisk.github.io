            <h1>My comprehension about Web front-end programming</h1>
            <h3>Jun. 30, 2016</h3>
            <p>My comprehension about Web front-end programming is, in short,</p>
            <p><strong><em>front-end = 1% * HTML + 1% * CSS + 98% * Javascript.</strong></em></p>
            <p>Why I'm saying that. Although most of the programmers think that it is the DOM of HTML that span the whole web page, the truth is that even without a single HTML tag it can also generate the entire DOM tree with Javascript. Of course, Javascript can also substitute CSS. </p>
            <p>In fact, in many of the most wonderful front-end projects, the code quantity of Javascript is way much larger than that of both HTML and CSS. Because Javascript is much more powerful than HTML and CSS, which means there are things that Javascript can do but definitely not with the rest. For example, what if I want to adjust the background color depending on the position of cursor or make some objects move randomly? Soon you can find out that what Javascript can easily handle, HTML and CSS can not. That's why Javascript is that important for front-end programming. </p>
            <p>However, Javascript is not easy at all. It's grammers look surprisingly like lisp, as we know, kind of the functional-programming language. There is no exactly the concept of "object" in Javascript. The keyword "new" is a fake of it, simulating the "new" keyword in normal OOP language.<strong>Therefore, for the sake of learning front-end programming, learn Javascript as well as possible.</strong></p>
